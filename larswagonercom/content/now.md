This is my now page, where I share what I'm up to right now. You can read more [here](https://nownownow.com/about).

* Studying mathematics in Amsterdam, with focus on algebra and geometry. 
* Teaching assistant for a few first year courses (most recently, Group Theory). 
* Playing basketball, going bouldering and mostly being bad at both!
* Sunset strolls in the nearby parks are a personal favorite. 
* Trying to work through my evergrowing collection of books (**Antonio Azor√≠n** stands out). 
* [This](https://www.poemas-del-alma.com/yo-voy-sonando-caminos.htm) is one of my favorite poems by one of my favorite poets.
* Also interested in category theory, theoretical computer science and geometric deep learning.
* Taking advantage of cheap flights/buses. Most recently went to Croatia.
* Going to the cinema a few times a week, wasn't very impressed by the new Benedict Cumberbatch film.
