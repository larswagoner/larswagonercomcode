This is my now page, where I share what I'm up to right now. You can read more [here](https://nownownow.com/about).

*  In Valencia. Paris, NY, DC and CDMX by the end of the month.
*  Recently came from Zagrilla Alta near Priego de Córdoba, where the locals offered me drinks and cigars!
*  Working with the lovely people at Algebraic AI and the de Polavieja Lab at the Champalimaud Foundation "Centre of the Unknown".
*  Interested in living life more slowly and intentionally.
*  Finishing Orwell's Homage to Cataluña.
*  At some point in the (very?) near future I would like to familiarize myself with: formal verification, entrepreneurship, quantum mechanics, spectral hypergraph theory... basically computer stuff, business stuff and operator stuff.
