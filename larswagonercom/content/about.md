Hello! I'm Lars. 

I grew up in Spain but I currently live in Amsterdam. I can speak English and Spanish fluently, my French is probably not that bad, my Italian is decent if you don't speak Italian, and my Dutch is embarassingly weak. In general, I find mathematics and related fields interesting, in particular the intersection between pure math and AI. I spend a good amount of time reading (basically anything), so I will gladly accept any recommendations. I also spend a good amount of time on a bicycle, but there isn't really much choice in this city :) 

You can read more about my current interests on my [Now page](https://larswagoner.com/now). You can also check out some of the projects I have worked on [here](https://larswagoner.com/categories/projects/). If you would like to get in touch, you can send an email to contact@larswagoner.com, or you can just stalk my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larswagoner/), I'll get the hint.

This website uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator, I have made some tweaks to the [Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme and everything is hosted for free on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)!
