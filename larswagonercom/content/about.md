Hello! I'm Lars. 

I am a grad student in mathematics in Leiden and Bordeaux. Interested in algebra, logic, formal methods, computer science and machine learning. Practically, looking to explore information security and AI safety. 

[This](https://www.poemas-del-alma.com/yo-voy-sonando-caminos.htm) is one of my favorite poems by one of my favorite poets. You can read more about my current interests on my [Now page](https://larswagoner.com/now). You can also check out some of the projects I have worked on [here](https://larswagoner.com/categories/projects/). If you would like to get in touch, you can send an email to contact@larswagoner.com, or you can just stalk my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larswagoner/), I'll get the hint.

This website uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator, I have made some tweaks to the [Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme and everything is hosted for free on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)!
