I think what I'll do is I'll write this post, a more casual explanation of everything, kinda skipping over some of the details esp. for the standard model, then at the beginning I'll link to the paper that teo, bernardo and I did, then I'll link to this new paper that I do after writing this and maybe with some support from magnus. Writing a new paper allows me to reference the paper we already did without rewriting that one, and I can put my own spin off it. 

** Index for this post **
        1. Introducing both papers, giving a bit of backstory and motivation.
        2. My experience working on a team [IDK HOW PERSONAL I WANT TO GET, MAYBE KEEP IT PROFESSIONAL BUT STILL LET MY PERSONALITY SHOW THROUGH, NOT TOO EMOTIONAL BASICALLY]


** Index for second paper ** -- Once I have made a bit of progress with the results, email Magnus and ask if he would like to be involved, if not thats no biggie. 
        1. Start off directly with the vanilla model we arrived at, reiterate my model but maybe explain it a bit more (both aspects the GM model and the M-GM model, really go into detail). 
        2. New contributions (double check results from the previous model, and then explore the other things I was interested in -- tbh I cant really remember everything else I wanted to know but I think after a re-read of the paper my natural curiosity will lead me down a good path)
