Over the summer I was a *Machine Learning Safety Scholar* at the Center for AI Safety (CAIS), headquartered in Berkeley, CA. We went over topics in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and ML Safety, including trojans, robustness and interpretability, all while implementing what we learned in Python using standard ML libraries. There were numerous guest speakers and discussion opportunities, as well as the analysis of many relevant papers in the field.
