In this project for the "Honours Programme" I studied and presented The Fundamental Theorem for Finitely Generated Modules over a Principal Ideal Domain, along with the relevant lemmas, corollaries and algorithms. In particular, I deduced and presented an algorithm to determine the structure of a module M in terms of the direct sums of quotient modules of a Euclidean Domain, R.
