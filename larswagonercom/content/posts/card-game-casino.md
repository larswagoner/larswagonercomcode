I learned how to play *Casino*, the card game, many years ago while traveling through Thailand. I played it intermitently over the years but I thought it would make for a fun programming project, so a friend and I spent a few weeks in 2021 making a version of the card game playable from the terminal! The current version works if you know how to play ([this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrdSVHMYocc) has the instructions) and we even added some extra bells and whistles, but of course it could be tidied up a bit and given a graphical interface, but that is low priority for now. 

You can find the project in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/larswagoner/casino-py). Enjoy!
